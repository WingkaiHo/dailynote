3. Ubuntu 安在RAID的系统上无法开机
```
Software-RAID: Where the RAID is created by software.
Hardware-RAID: A special controller used to build RAID. Hardware RAID is
generally faster, and does not place load on the CPU, and hardware RAID can be
used with any OS
FakeRAID: Since RAID hardware is very expensive, many motherboard
manufacturers use multi-channel controllers with special BIOS features to
perform RAID. This is a form of software RAID using special drivers, and it is
not necessarily faster than true software RAID. Read FakeRaidHowto for
details.
